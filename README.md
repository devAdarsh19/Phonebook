<p>I am Adarsh Vinod, 1st year B.Tech at CMRIT and this is my first project. This is the code for a Phonebook directory written in Python. It is a very basic program that can access a contact from a pre-defined dictionary of contacts and print their personal details. It can also add a contact to its dictionary. Given the time limit for the first review, this is all I could do so far. Currently the code has drawbacks such as, not being able to make the new contacts a permanent member of its dictionary. I will be working on it after the first review and will bring changes to the code before the first semester ends (that is before March).</p>
